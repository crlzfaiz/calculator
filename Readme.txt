First code iteration: ~ 4 hours

Assumptions
1. all entries in string are valid

iterate array and determine the following
1. open bracket and corresponding close bracket
2. arithmetic operators and associated numbers
3. create a stack to store and load calculation
4. handle multiplication/division first before addition/subtraction
5. handle calculation in bracket first before anything else
6. error handling for invalid input
7. handle 2 sets of brackets
8. use 2 stacks to store value and operator
9. determine precedence
10. make sure the number are in correct order for calculation as they are removed from the stack
